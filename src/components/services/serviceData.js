        head: "What is GRP & FRP ?",
        text2: "GRP stands for Glass Reinforced Plastic. GRP products are also called fiberglass products, composite plastic products and FRP products. FRP stands for Fiber-Reinforced Polymer. FRP is a composite material formed of polymer matrix reinforced with fiber. Although the fibers used are usually glass fiber, as in GRP, others applied fibers are carbon fiber, aramid fiber or basalt fiber. Selection of fiber and resin is purely based on the application of final product since the properties of different composite material or FPR broadly changes based on the composition.",

            "UV resistance: UV resistance makes GRP a safe product for all outdoor requirements.",
            "Mouldability: Easily molded into most designs making it aesthetically pleasing.",
            "Nonconductive: GRP is an insulator; hence it widens the application of GRP to various sectors.",
            "Corrosion Resistance: FRP will withstand the harshest environments due to its corrosion resistant properties.",
            "Sustainability: FRP products are gaining more attention as a LEED recognized, or certifiable environmentally sustainable building material."
